Description
--------------

`Punchcard` is a customizable punchcard view written in Swift that can be used to display a measure of progression through a series of actions.

![Example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/879038/21446576/d06ec366-c895-11e6-8535-b4d01313a0b3.png)

In this screenshot the user has achieved 2 out of 5 punches, and the images used are the [StockX](https://stockx.com) logo.

--------------

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate `Punchcard` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Punchcard'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

In case Xcode complains (<i>"Cannot load underlying module for Punchcard"</i>) go to Product and choose Clean (or simply press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>).

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate `Punchcard` into your project manually.

--------------

`Punchcard` is state based. To configure the view, simply update the state value with whatever values you'd like, and re-set the state:

1) First you should set up the `Punchcard`:

```swift
var punchcardView = PunchcardView()

var state = punchcardView.state
state.backgroundColor = UIColor(patternImage: UIImage(named: "Punchcard-Background-Pattern")!)
state.borderColor = .lightGray
state.emptyPunchImage = UIImage(named: "X-Stamp-Empty")
state.filledPunchImage = UIImage(named: "X-Stamp-Fill")
state.punchesRequired = 5
state.punchNumberColor = .black
state.punchNumberFont = .systemFont(ofSize: 14)
state.rewardTextFont = .systemFont(ofSize: 11)
state.rewardText = "FREE SHIPPING"
state.rewardTextColor = .gray
state.rewardFillColor = .green
        
punchcardView.state = state
```

2) In order to set the punches received, modify the `state` object:

```swift

var state = punchcardView.state
state.punchesReceived = 2
punchcardView.state = state
```
